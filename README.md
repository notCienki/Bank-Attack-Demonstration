# Fake AdBlocker - Advanced Banking Form Attack Demonstration

This project was created as part of the "Introduction to Computer Security" course at the University of Wroc≈Çaw. It demonstrates an advanced attack that involves replacing bank account numbers in online transfer forms while hiding this manipulation from the user.

The attack uses a browser extension that pretends to be a popular ad blocker ("AdGuard Free"). This camouflage technique increases the chances that a user will voluntarily install malicious software.
