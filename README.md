# Fake AdBlocker - Attack Demonstration

This project was created as part of the "Introduction to Computer Security" course at the University of Wrocław. It demonstrates an attack that involves replacing bank account numbers in online transfer forms while hiding this manipulation from the user.

The attack uses a browser extension that pretends to be a popular ad blocker ("AdGuard Free"). This camouflage technique increases the chances that a user will voluntarily install malicious software.
